# Word-Guess-Game

### Overview
This is a simple word guessing game where a user attempts to correctly guess the current displayed Pokemon. The user does this by entering keys on their keyboard and having them either fill in the name of the Pokemon if they are correct or storing wrong letters. Duplicate letters are automatically filled in when correctly guessed, but duplicate wrong guesses do not continue to count as a wrong guess. The user wins if the name is discovered and loses if they fail to guess the name correctly after 10 incorrect guesses.

### Modes

There are two game modes. The default mode is easy and displays a silhouette of the Pokemon to be guessed. Hard mode removes the silhouette and the user must blindly try and determine the Pokemon. New Game restores the game to its original state, removing previous wins and any letters already guessed. There is an option to play music as well.
